## Introduction

This AI Governance Platform is designed to accelerate responsible, transparent, and explainable AI workflows. It provides a unified, integrated solution to govern both generative AI and predictive machine learning (ML) models across their entire lifecycle. Governance makes AI practical at the enterprise level. As reported by the Harvard Business Review, “to call generative AI revolutionary is not hyperbole. It has the potential to improve productivity in any function that involves cognitive tasks.” While the promise of AI is undeniable, the risks are real. A well-considered approach to governance gives everyone permission to move ahead. With governance as your safety net, there’s no reason to hold back from the revolutionary aspects of AI.

### Challenges of Scaling AI

The influence of AI is growing exponentially as organizational leaders deploy the technology in nearly every industry. However, scaling AI comes with several challenges:

1. **Operationalizing AI with Confidence**:
    - A wide variety of tools exist for AI governance—but too often, models are built without proper clarity, monitoring, or cataloging. Without end-to-end AI lifecycle tracking using automated processes, scalability and transparent processes are hindered.

2. **Managing Risk and Reputation**:
    - Unfair, unexplainable, or biased AI models in production can lead to incorrect assumptions and decisions, affecting customers and harming your brand. Explainable processes and results help auditors and customers understand how specific analytic results were reached, ensuring results don’t reflect bias.

3. **Changing AI Regulations**:
    - Successful AI requires adherence to laws and regulations, which are proliferating rapidly. Noncompliance could cost organizations significant fines. New regulations will require model documentation for metadata and lineage.

4. **Ethical Issues**:
    - Business leaders see ethical issues like explainability, ethics, bias, and trust as major concerns in AI adoption.


## AI Governance Components

The platform consists of three main components:

1. **AI Documentation**: Capture facts about use cases, models, and prompts throughout the lifecycle.
2. **AI Evaluation & Monitoring**: Monitor model health, accuracy, drift, bias, explainability, and generative AI quality.
3. **AI Risk Governance**: Maintain use case & AI asset inventory, workflows, risk assessments, dashboards, and issue management.

### AI Use Case Management

All AI implementations start with defining an AI use case. This includes a detailed description, clear objectives, and the scope of the AI implementation. A well-defined use case provides a foundation for developing a transparent and responsible AI implementation, enabling effective risk assessment and control implementation.

### AI Risk Library

Maintain a comprehensive AI risk library, which includes detailed descriptions and risk ratings. This library helps in identifying potential risks associated with AI use cases and proposes measures to mitigate these risks. Each risk is mapped to applicable controls, ensuring a robust risk management framework.

### Centralized Risk Management

Implement a structured approach to manage and mitigate risks associated with AI use cases. This includes tracking AI use cases, conducting dynamic risk assessments, and implementing real-time risk management dashboards.


### Holistic AI Governance

Implementing AI governance requires the intersection of people, process, and technology:

- **People**: Ensure cross-functional collaboration among data scientists, engineers, business leaders, and compliance officers.
- **Process**: Trace and document the origin of data, associated models, and metadata for audit. Automate governance workflows in line with compliance requirements.
- **Technology**: Use solutions that integrate data of many types and sources, offer self-service access with privacy controls, and automate model building, deployment, scaling, training, and monitoring.


## Generative AI Quality Assurance Metrics

The platform offers several out-of-the-box metrics for monitoring generative AI quality:

- **ROUGE**: Assesses how well a generated summary compares to reference summaries.
- **SARI**: Compares predicted simplified sentences against reference and source sentences.
- **HAP (Hate, Abuse & Profanity)**: Measures toxic content in input and output data.
- **PII**: Detects personally identifiable information in input and output data.
- **Readability**: Determines the readability, complexity, and grade level of the model's output.
- **Drift v2**: Evaluates changes in model output, prediction accuracy, and input data distribution.
- **Explainability**: Ensures that model predictions can be understood by humans.
- **Fairness**: Monitors for biases in model predictions based on race, gender, age, and other factors.


## Performance and Cost Metrics

To optimize AI performance and ensure cost efficiency, the platform monitors:

- **Throughput**: Number of processing tasks handled within a specific time frame.
- **Latency**: Time taken for an AI model to process a request and generate a response.
- **Number of Tokens**: Volume of input and output data processed by an AI model.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Measures the cost associated with running AI models and identifies areas for optimization.

## AI Factsheets

AI Factsheets serve as a starting point for AI model governance. They provide:

- Standardized documentation of essential information about AI models and services.
- Customizable format based on applicable regulations and key reporting dimensions.
- Comprehensive overview of model development, capabilities, and benchmark performance.
- Transparency and Traceability: Ensures that all aspects of the AI model, from data sources to model predictions, are transparent and traceable.

## Monitoring and Alerting

The platform offers robust monitoring and alerting capabilities:

- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Provides on-demand dashboards and reports for real-time visibility into model performance.
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends automated email notifications when predefined thresholds for key metrics are breached.
- **Exportable Snapshots**: Allows exportable snapshots of current model status with all key information and metrics.
- **Proactive Risk Management**: Monitors for risks such as bias, drift, and regulatory compliance, providing alerts and recommendations for mitigation.
